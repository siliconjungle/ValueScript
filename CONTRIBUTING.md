## No Suitable Good-First-Issues?

Hopefully this doesn't affect you, but if it does, please
[create an issue](https://github.com/voltrevo/ValueScript/issues/new?title=Good%20first%20issue%28s%29%20wanted&body=%28Please%20tell%20us%20a%20bit%20about%20yourself%20and%20what%20interests%20you%20about%20ValueScript.%29)
about it :).

## Contributing Bigger Things

If you want to get involved with something bigger than a good-first-issue, we'll
be very happy to discuss that with you once you've done a few good-first-issues.
